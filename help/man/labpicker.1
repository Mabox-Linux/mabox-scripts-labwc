.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBlabpicker\fR is a color picker that uses \fBslurp\fR and \fBgrim\fR.\&
These programs rely on \fIzwlr_layer_shell_v1\fR and \fIwlr-screencopy-unstable-v1\fR
(maybe be replaced with \fIext-image-capture-source-v1\fR and
\fIext-image-copy-capture-v1\fR in the future) wayland protocols
(implemented in wlroots-based compositors, e.\&g.\& \fBsway\fR).\&
.PP
It has several output options, they can be combined.\&
.PP
\fI--copy\fR needs \fBwl-clipboard\fR to be installed.\&
.PP
\fI--draw\fR and \fI--escape\fR need a terminal with truecolor support (e.\&g.\& \fBfoot\fR).\&
.PP
\fI--notify\fR needs \fBlibnotify\fR to be installed
and a notification daemon (e.\&g.\& \fBmako\fR or \fBfnott\fR) to be running.\&
.PP
\fI--print\fR and \fI--draw\fR are selected by default if no arguments are provided.\&
